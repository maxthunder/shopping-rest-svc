            1a( The sequence in which an phoneorder gets saved
                -probably needs to be save phoneorder, then save products)

            1b( This could also be handled by UI, with separate endpoints
            1c( separate endpoints by be nice for api either way 
             
            I UTIMATELY BELIEVE THE BEST ROUTE IS SEPARTE ENDPOINTS: 
               1) /CartOrders
                   - takes:(CartOrderJSON)
                   - returns:(CartOrderId:Integer)
                   - start new phone cart order by saving a new order and return id
               2a) /phonePurchasedItems
                   - takes:(products:List<PhoneItemMapRef>, CartOrderId:Integer)
                   - returns:(referenceNumber:String)  
                   - save all phone product maps and returns reference number
                   - BENEFIT: could be multithreaded through REST svc down the road
               2b) /phoneItem  
                   - takes:(product:PhoneItemMapRef)
                   - returns:(phoneitemId:PhoneItemMapRef)  
                   - save phone product and returns phone product
                   - CAVEAT: then multiple threading mut happen on angular (gross)

               3) downside to having itemNames in /CartOrders ? - product resources are coupled with cart order
               3) benefits?c- single call (more performant, less dev, less complex input since orderid would be contained), less

(phoneitem= (cartOrderId,[phonePurchasedItems]))

--------------------ANGULAR--------------------|--------------------JAVA--------------------|
    customer@name exists?                           GET /customers : POST /customers
    create order                                    POST /CartOrders
    add phone products using orderId,products             POST /phonePurchasedItems
